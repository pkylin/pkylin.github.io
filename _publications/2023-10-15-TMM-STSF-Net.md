Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding agents is an important issue for building up an intelligent transportation system. Frequent interactions among agents have a major impact on their movement patterns. Current research mainly relies on agentsâ€™ spatial structure associated with the last frame of the observation to model social interactions, while paying less attention to structure information from previous moments. In addition, existing methods merely consider temporal features of a single trajectory sequence, while neglecting temporal dependencies across multiple trajectories. In this work, we endeavor to capture comprehensively social interactions among agents with the proposed Spatio-Temporal Sequence Fusion Network (STSF-Net). Specifically, we construct a spatio-temporal sequence that encodes contextual information taking explicitly spatial distributions of agents during movement into account while capturing socially temporal dependencies across multiple trajectory sequences. Besides, a social recurrent mechanism is introduced to explicitly capture temporal correlations between interactions by concerning spatial structure at each time-step. Finally, our model is evaluated on datasets covering pedestrian, vehicle, and heterogeneous multi-agent trajectories. Experimental evidence manifests that our method achieves excellent performance.
